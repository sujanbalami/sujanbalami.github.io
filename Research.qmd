# Plant-microbe interactions

## Mutualistic and pathogenic interactions

```         
Mutualistic interactions with arbuscular and ecto- mycorrhizal fungi

Pathogenic interaction with plant-pathogenic fungi
```

#### Mechanisms of interactions

```         
Molecular signalling
```

#### Factors affecting plant-microbe interactions

```         
Climate warming and changes in plant-mutualistic, and plant-pathogenic fungi interactions
```

#### Applied aspects

```         
Plant-microbiome and increase fitness of plants
